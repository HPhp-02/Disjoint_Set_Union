This Data Structure is  generally used with Graphs and Trees .<br/>
Used to detect cycle in an Undirected Graph.<br/>
Used in Kruskal Algorithim for finding Minimum Spanning Tree .<br/>
It use Union-Find Algorithim with Path-Compression to set the parents of nodes in a particular set , which uses only O(log(n)) of time complexity .<br/>
Therfore cycle can be detected by just comparing the parents which also takes O(log(n)) .
It has many application so you can also visit the URL: [https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/disjoint_set_union.html] for better understanding .
